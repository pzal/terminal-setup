#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

# font_family      monospace
# bold_font        auto
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. The easiest way to select fonts is to run the `kitten
#: choose-fonts` command which will present a nice UI for you to
#: select the fonts you want with previews and support for selecting
#: variable fonts and font features. If you want to learn to select
#: fonts manually, read the font specification syntax
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/choose-fonts/#font-spec-
#: syntax>.

font_size 12.0

#: Font size (in pts).

# disable_ligatures never

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
#: default is to always render them. You can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be set per-window
#: either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
#: shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::

#:     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#:     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#:     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

#: Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features option.

# font_features

#: E.g. font_features none

#: Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. Note
#: that for the main fonts, features can be specified when selecting
#: the font using the choose-fonts kitten. This setting is useful for
#: fallback fonts.

#: Some fonts might have features worthwhile in a terminal. For
#: example, Fira Code includes a discretionary feature, zero, which in
#: that font changes the appearance of the zero (0), to make it more
#: easily distinguishable from Ã˜. Fira Code also includes other
#: discretionary features known as Stylistic Sets which have the tags
#: ss01 through ss20.

#: For the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the
#: HarfBuzz documentation <https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-
#: common.html#hb-feature-from-string>.

#: Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font
#: family. This allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.

#: On Linux, font features are first read from the FontConfig database
#: and then this option is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place.

#: To get the PostScript name for a font, use the `fc-scan file.ttf`
#: command on Linux or the `Font Book tool on macOS
#: <https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/79875/how-can-i-get-the-
#: postscript-name-of-a-ttf-font-installed-in-os-x>`__.

#: Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum

#: Enable only alternate zero in the bold font::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Bold +zero

#: Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::

#:     font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt

#: In conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable Arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. You can do this with e.g.::

#:     font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init

# modify_font
modify_font cell_height 125%

#: Modify font characteristics such as the position or thickness of
#: the underline and strikethrough. The modifications can have the
#: suffix px for pixels or % for percentage of original value. No
#: suffix means use pts. For example::

#:     modify_font underline_position -2
#:     modify_font underline_thickness 150%
#:     modify_font strikethrough_position 2px

#: Additionally, you can modify the size of the cell in which each
#: font glyph is rendered and the baseline at which the glyph is
#: placed in the cell. For example::

#:     modify_font cell_width 80%
#:     modify_font cell_height -2px
#:     modify_font baseline 3

#: Note that modifying the baseline will automatically adjust the
#: underline and strikethrough positions by the same amount.
#: Increasing the baseline raises glyphs inside the cell and
#: decreasing it lowers them. Decreasing the cell size might cause
#: rendering artifacts, so use with care.

# box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: The sizes of the lines used for the box drawing Unicode characters.
#: These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the monitor DPI to
#: arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values corresponding to
#: thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

# undercurl_style thin-sparse

#: The style with which undercurls are rendered. This option takes the
#: form (thin|thick)-(sparse|dense). Thin and thick control the
#: thickness of the undercurl. Sparse and dense control how often the
#: curl oscillates. With sparse the curl will peak once per character,
#: with dense twice. Changing this option dynamically via reloading
#: the config or remote control is undefined.

# underline_exclusion 1

#: By default kitty renders gaps in underlines when they overlap with
#: descenders (the parts of letters below the baseline, such as for y,
#: q, p etc.). This option controls the thickness of the gaps. It can
#: be either a unitless number in which case it is a fraction of the
#: underline thickness as specified in the font or it can have a
#: suffix of px for pixels or pt for points. Set to zero to disable
#: the gaps. Changing this option dynamically via reloading the config
#: or remote control is undefined.

# text_composition_strategy platform

#: Control how kitty composites text glyphs onto the background color.
#: The default value of platform tries for text rendering as close to
#: "native" for the platform kitty is running on as possible.

#: A value of legacy uses the old (pre kitty 0.28) strategy for how
#: glyphs are composited. This will make dark text on light
#: backgrounds look thicker and light text on dark backgrounds
#: thinner. It might also make some text appear like the strokes are
#: uneven.

#: You can fine tune the actual contrast curve used for glyph
#: composition by specifying up to two space-separated numbers for
#: this setting.

#: The first number is the gamma adjustment, which controls the
#: thickness of dark text on light backgrounds. Increasing the value
#: will make text appear thicker. The default value for this is 1.0 on
#: Linux and 1.7 on macOS. Valid values are 0.01 and above. The result
#: is scaled based on the luminance difference between the background
#: and the foreground. Dark text on light backgrounds receives the
#: full impact of the curve while light text on dark backgrounds is
#: affected very little.

#: The second number is an additional multiplicative contrast. It is
#: percentage ranging from 0 to 100. The default value is 0 on Linux
#: and 30 on macOS.

#: If you wish to achieve similar looking thickness in light and dark
#: themes, a good way to experiment is start by setting the value to
#: 1.0 0 and use a dark theme. Then adjust the second parameter until
#: it looks good. Then switch to a light theme and adjust the first
#: parameter until the perceived thickness matches the dark theme.

# text_fg_override_threshold 0

#: A setting to prevent low contrast between foreground and background
#: colors. Useful when working with applications that use colors that
#: do not contrast well with your preferred color scheme. The default
#: value is 0, which means no color overriding is performed. There are
#: two modes of operation:

#: A value with the suffix ratio represents the minimum accepted
#: contrast ratio between the foreground and background color.
#: Possible values range from 0.0 ratio to 21.0 ratio. For example, to
#: meet WCAG level AA
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines>
#: a value of 4.5 ratio can be provided. The algorithm is implemented
#: using HSLuv <https://www.hsluv.org/> which enables it to change the
#: perceived lightness of a color just as much as needed without
#: really changing its hue and saturation.

#: A value with the suffix % represents the minimum accepted
#: difference in luminance between the foreground and background
#: color, below which kitty will override the foreground color. It is
#: percentage ranging from 0 % to 100 %. If the difference in
#: luminance of the foreground and background is below this threshold,
#: the foreground color will be set to white if the background is dark
#: or black if the background is light.

#: WARNING: Some programs use characters (such as block characters)
#: for graphics display and may expect to be able to set the
#: foreground and background to the same color (or similar colors). If
#: you see unexpected stripes, dots, lines, incorrect color, no color
#: where you expect color, or any kind of graphic display problem try
#: setting text_fg_override_threshold to 0 to see if this is the cause
#: of the problem or consider using the ratio mode of operation
#: described above instead of the % mode of operation.

#: }}}

#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 10000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

# scrollback_indicator_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the scrollback indicator which is a small colored
#: rectangle that moves along the right hand side of the window as you
#: scroll, indicating what fraction you have scrolled. The default is
#: one which means fully opaque, aka visible. Set to a value between
#: zero and one to make the indicator less visible.

# scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
#: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position or
#: set to 0 if there is no cursor, for example, when showing the last
#: command output.

# scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: Separate scrollback history size (in MB), used only for browsing
#: the scrollback buffer with pager. This separate buffer is not
#: available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager
#: program when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The
#: current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximately
#: 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

#: Window layout {{{

# remember_window_size  yes
# initial_window_width  640
# initial_window_height 400

#: If enabled, the OS Window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the OS Window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

# remember_window_position no

#: If enabled, the OS Window position will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same position as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the OS Window will be placed by the window
#: manager. Note that remembering of position only works if the
#: underlying desktop environment/window manager supports it. It never
#: works on Wayland. See also kitty --position to specify the position
#: when launching kitty.

# active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

# inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows.

# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

# inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

hide_window_decorations no

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only and titlebar-and-corners can be used
#: to only hide the titlebar and the rounded corners. Whether this
#: works and exactly what effect it has depends on the window
#: manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing this
#: option when reloading config are undefined. When using titlebar-
#: only, it is useful to also set window_margin_width and
#: placement_strategy to prevent the rounded corners from clipping
#: text. Or use titlebar-and-corners.

# confirm_os_window_close 1

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. You can also have
#: backgrounded jobs prevent closing, by adding count-background to
#: the setting, for example: -1 count-background. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.

#: }}}

#: Tab bar {{{

# tab_bar_edge bottom

#: The edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.

# tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts).

# tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0

#: The margin above and below the tab bar (in pts). The first number
#: is the margin between the edge of the OS Window and the tab bar.
#: The second number is the margin between the tab bar and the
#: contents of the current tab.

# tab_bar_style fade

#: The tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (See also
#:     tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (See also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     A user-supplied Python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file
#:     tab_bar.py in the kitty config directory. For examples of how to
#:     write such a function, see the functions named draw_tab_with_* in
#:     kitty's source code: kitty/tab_bar.py. See also
#:     this discussion <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447>
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create
#:     a mapping for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of
#:     tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

# tab_bar_align left

#: The horizontal alignment of the tab bar, can be one of: left,

# background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. See also transparent_background_colors. Be aware that using
#: a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit.
#: When using a low value for this setting, it is desirable that you
#: set the background color to a color the matches the general color
#: of the desktop background, for best text rendering. Note that to
#: workaround window managers not doing gamma-corrected blending kitty
#: makes background_opacity non-linear which means, especially for
#: light backgrounds you might need to make the value much lower than
#: you expect to get good results, see 6218
#: <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/6218> for details.

#: If you want to dynamically change transparency of windows, set
#: dynamic_background_opacity to yes (this is off by default as it has
#: a performance cost). Changing this option when reloading the config
#: will only work if dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the
#: original config.

# background_blur 0

#: Set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the
#: visuals behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it.
#: Only takes effect when background_opacity is less than one. On
#: macOS, this will also control the blur radius (amount of blurring).
#: Setting it to too high a value will cause severe performance issues
#: and/or rendering artifacts. Usually, values up to 64 work well.
#: Note that this might cause performance issues, depending on how the
#: platform implements it, so use with care. Currently supported on
#: macOS and KDE.

clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

# clipboard_max_size 512

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.

# allow_cloning ask

#: Control whether programs running in the terminal can request new
#: windows to be created. The canonical example is clone-in-kitty
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#clone-shell>.
#: By default, kitty will ask for permission for each clone request.
#: Allowing cloning unconditionally gives programs running in the
#: terminal (including over SSH) permission to execute arbitrary code,
#: as the user who is running the terminal, on the computer that the
#: terminal is running on.

# clone_source_strategies venv,conda,env_var,path

#: Control what shell code is sourced when running clone-in-kitty in
#: the newly cloned window. The supported strategies are:

#: venv
#:     Source the file $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate. This is used by the
#:     Python stdlib venv module and allows cloning venvs automatically.
#: conda
#:     Run conda activate $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV. This supports the virtual
#:     environments created by conda.
#: env_var
#:     Execute the contents of the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_CODE with eval.
#: path
#:     Source the file pointed to by the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_PATH.

#: This option must be a comma separated list of the above values.
#: Only the first valid match, in the order specified, is sourced.

# notify_on_cmd_finish never

#: Show a desktop notification when a long-running command finishes
#: (needs shell_integration). The possible values are:

#: never
#:     Never send a notification.

#: unfocused
#:     Only send a notification when the window does not have keyboard focus.

#: invisible
#:     Only send a notification when the window both is unfocused and not visible
#:     to the user, for example, because it is in an inactive tab or its OS window
#:     is not currently visible (on platforms that support OS window visibility querying
#:     this considers an OS Window visible iff it is active).

#: always
#:     Always send a notification, regardless of window state.

#: There are two optional arguments:

#: First, the minimum duration for what is considered a long running
#: command. The default is 5 seconds. Specify a second argument to set
#: the duration. For example: invisible 15. Do not set the value too
#: small, otherwise a command that launches a new OS Window and exits
#: will spam a notification.

#: Second, the action to perform. The default is notify. The possible
#: values are:

#: notify
#:     Send a desktop notification. The subsequent arguments are optional and specify when
#:     the notification is automatically cleared. The set of possible events when the notification is
#:     cleared are: focus and next. focus means that when the notification
#:     policy is unfocused or invisible the notification is automatically cleared
#:     when the window regains focus. The value of next means that the previous notification
#:     is cleared when the next notification is shown. The default when no arguments are specified
#:     is: focus next.

#: bell
#:     Ring the terminal bell.

#: command
#:     Run a custom command. All subsequent arguments are the cmdline to run.

#: Some more examples::

#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 5 seconds in an unfocused window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused
#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0
#:     # Ring a bell when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 bell
#:     # Run 'notify-send' when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     # Here %c is replaced by the current command line and %s by the job exit code
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 command notify-send "job finished with status: %s" %c
#:     # Do not clear previous notification when next command finishes or window regains focus
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 5.0 notify

# term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

macos_option_as_alt left

#: Use the Option key as an Alt key on macOS. With this set to no,
#: kitty will use the macOS native Option+Key to enter Unicode
#: character behavior. This will break any Alt+Key keyboard shortcuts
#: in your terminal programs, but you can use the macOS Unicode input
#: technique. You can use the values: left, right or both to use only
#: the left, right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Note that
#: kitty itself always treats Option the same as Alt. This means you
#: cannot use this option to configure different kitty shortcuts for
#: Option+Key vs. Alt+Key. Also, any kitty shortcuts using
#: Option/Alt+Key will take priority, so that any such key presses
#: will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes on macOS. For example, a
#: value of 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-
#: pixel antialiasing at common font sizes. Note that in modern kitty,
#: this option is obsolete (although still supported). Consider using
#: text_composition_strategy instead.

# macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the macOS traditional full-screen transition, that is faster,
#: but less pretty.

# macos_show_window_title_in all

#: Control where the window title is displayed on macOS. A value of
#: window will show the title of the currently active window at the
#: top of the macOS window. A value of menubar will show the title of
#: the currently active window in the macOS global menu bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. A value of all will show the title
#: in both places, and none hides the title. See
#: macos_menubar_title_max_length for how to control the length of the
#: title in the menu bar.

# macos_menubar_title_max_length 0

#: The maximum number of characters from the window title to show in
#: the macOS global menu bar. Values less than one means that there is
#: no maximum limit.

# macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Use a custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see on both
#: light and dark backgrounds. Nowadays, the default macOS cursor
#: already comes with a white border. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines. Changing this option
#: by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_colorspace srgb

#: The colorspace in which to interpret terminal colors. The default
#: of srgb will cause colors to match those seen in web browsers. The
#: value of default will use whatever the native colorspace of the
#: display is. The value of displayp3 will use Apple's special
#: snowflake display P3 color space, which will result in over
#: saturated (brighter) colors with some color shift. Reloading
#: configuration will change this value only for newly created OS
#: windows.

# linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

# wayland_enable_ime yes

#: Enable Input Method Extension on Wayland. This is typically used
#: for inputting text in East Asian languages. However, its
#: implementation in Wayland is often buggy and introduces latency
#: into the input loop, so disable this if you know you dont need it.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported, it
#: will not have any effect.

#::      map f1 clear_terminal scrollback active
#::      # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#::      map f1 clear_terminal scroll active
#::      # Clear everything on screen up to the line with the cursor or the start of the current prompt (needs shell integration)
#::      map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor active
#::      # Same as above except cleared lines are moved into scrollback
#::      map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor_scroll active

#::  If you want to operate on all kitty windows instead of just the
#::  current one, use all instead of active.

#::  Some useful functions that can be defined in the shell rc files
#::  to perform various kinds of clearing of the current window:

#::  .. code-block:: sh

#::      clear-only-screen() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[2J"
#::      }

#::      clear-screen-and-scrollback() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[3J"

#::      clear-screen-saving-contents-in-scrollback() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[22J"
#::      }

#::  For instance, using these escape codes, it is possible to remap
#::  Ctrl+L to both scroll the current screen contents into the
#::  scrollback buffer and clear the screen, instead of just clearing
#::  the screen. For ZSH, in ~/.zshrc, add:

#::  .. code-block:: zsh

#::      ctrl_l() {
#::          builtin print -rn -- $'\r\e[0J\e[H\e[22J' >"$TTY"
#::          builtin zle .reset-prompt
#::          builtin zle -R
#::      }
#::      zle -N ctrl_l
#::      bindkey '^l' ctrl_l

#::  Alternatively, you can just add map ctrl+l clear_terminal
#::  to_cursor_scroll active to kitty.conf which works with no changes
#::  to the shell rc files, but only clears up to the prompt, it does
#::  not clear any text at the prompt itself.

#: Clear to start

# map cmd+k clear_terminal to_cursor active

#: Clear scrollback

# map option+cmd+k clear_terminal scrollback active

#: Clear screen

# map cmd+ctrl+l clear_terminal to_cursor_scroll active

#: Reload kitty.conf

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file
# map ctrl+cmd+,   load_config_file

#::  Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it
#::  was loaded. Note that a handful of options cannot be dynamically
#::  changed and require a full restart of kitty. Particularly, when
#::  changing shortcuts for actions located on the macOS global menu
#::  bar, a full restart is needed. You can also map a keybinding to
#::  load a different config file, for example::

#::      map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#::  Note that all options from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#::  in other words the new configuration *replace* the old ones.

#: Debug kitty configuration

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config
# map opt+cmd+,    debug_config

#::  Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running
#::  with and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.

#: Send arbitrary text on key presses

#::  E.g. map ctrl+shift+alt+h send_text all Hello World

#::  You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#::  client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For
#::  example::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#::  This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+A key
#::  combination. The text to be sent decodes ANSI C escapes
#::  <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/ANSI_002dC-
#::  Quoting.html> so you can use escapes like \e to send control
#::  codes or \u21fb to send Unicode characters (or you can just input
#::  the Unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). You can use
#::  `kitten show-key` to get the key escape codes you want to
#::  emulate.

#::  The first argument to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to
#::  activate the shortcut. The possible values are normal,
#::  application, kitty or a comma separated combination of them. The
#::  modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#::  for terminals, and kitty refers to the kitty extended keyboard
#::  protocol. The special value all means all of them.

#::  Some more examples::

#::      # Output a word and move the cursor to the start of the line (like typing and pressing Home)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\e[H
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\eOH
#::      # Run a command at a shell prompt (like typing the command and pressing Enter)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal,application some command with arguments\r
